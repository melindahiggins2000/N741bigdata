## Previously known issues...

1. First read the post on ![](images/so-logo.png){width=100} at [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5700505/windows-7-update-packages-problem-unable-to-move-temporary-installation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5700505/windows-7-update-packages-problem-unable-to-move-temporary-installation)

2. During your active RStudio session, at the command prompt you can run:
    * `trace(utils:::unpackPkgZip, edit=TRUE)`

3. When the editing window pops up, scroll to line 142 and change
    * `Sys.sleep(0.5)` to
    * `Sys.sleep(2)`
    
4. Click SAVE. This fixes the read/write time issue - **BUT ONLY FOR THIS RSTUDIO SESSION** YES, you will need to run during each RStudio session when you need to install new packages.
